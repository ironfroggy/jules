Ideas for improving Jules:

DONE:

- move posts from files to folders.
- move rendering to plugin system mostly.

TODO:

- Allow querying by directory.
- implement atom query plugin: render to the atom stream, which itself is
  sorted by date and such.
  
  Note that this has a lot of shared functionality with rendering to an URL.
  Likely we want to share the function using a more general "rendering" plugin
  which can be called by both.
- Possibly move all instantiation/usage of plugin subclasses into the plugin
  engine thing, including name/slot registration and such? who knows.
- "pack support"???
- static files component
  - finalization of plugins after site generation? need a defined process...
- "canonical rendering" of bundles; this is hard to figure out :S
  idea: canonical_for: "...{{foo}}..."
        This way we aren't limited to bundle keys, but can use anything in the
        document as a key. :>
        Maybe we add the bundle key as a builtin component so that it can be
        used, yes? YES.
 - General mechanism to say that a component is located by a nonstandard basename.
 - General mechanism to say that a component is located at a nonstandard directory.
 - General mechanism to say that a component has an unusual extension.
   (yes, the above three are all linked.)
 - Make engine just another dependency type for plugins.

NICE:
- Allow authors to unify content and YAML via a custom reST directive (reST only)
- move defaults into centralized location(s) rather than hardcoding when retrieved.
- Replace eval() with using jinja's expression syntax/semantics.
- dead link detection
- unused content detection
- detection of backwards-compatibility breakage in URLs
  (want so that never happens.)
- don't regenerate content that hasn't been updated
- definition of rewrite rules for web providers with rewrite rules.
