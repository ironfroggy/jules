Ideas for improving Jules:

TODO:

 - Allow querying by directory.
 - Integrate packs as bundles that just have a static component (effectively
   invisible for any reasonable query (only meta is present))
 - implement atom query/rendering plugin: render to the atom stream, which
   itself is sorted by date and such and rendered to a file.
 - General mechanism to say that a component is located by a nonstandard basename.
 - General mechanism to say that a component is located at a nonstandard directory.
 - General mechanism to say that a component has an unusual extension.
 - Make engine just another dependency type for plugins.

NICE:
- Allow authors to unify content and YAML via a custom reST directive (reST only)
- move defaults into centralized location(s) rather than hardcoding when retrieved.
- Replace eval() with using jinja's expression syntax/semantics?
- dead link detection
- unused content detection
- detection of backwards-compatibility breakage in URLs
  (want so that never happens.)
- don't regenerate content that hasn't been updated
- definition of rewrite rules for web providers with rewrite rules.
